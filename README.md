# Would You Rather Project

This is the starter code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## How to Start:

You can clone or download into your local computer, after that:

* run $npm install,
* run $npm start,
* Select the user to proceed Homepage,
* There will be few questions under 'Unanswered' and 'Answered' category.
