# Would-You-Rather Project

This is the starter code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## How to Start:

You can clone or download into your local computer, after that:

* run with npm: $npm install && npm start, or
* run with yarn: $yarn install && yarn start,

## How to Play:
* Select the user to proceed to Dashboard page,
<div align="center">

<div align="center">
    <img src="/public/images/dashboard.png" width="400px"</img>
